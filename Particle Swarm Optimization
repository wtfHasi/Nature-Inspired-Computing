Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. Each potential solution in PSO is represented as a "particle," and the swarm of particles works collectively to find the optimal solution in the search space.
Key Characteristics of PSO
1.	Population-Based: A group of particles searches the solution space simultaneously.
2.	Social Interaction: Particles share information with one another to guide the swarm toward the best solutions.
3.	Exploration and Exploitation: The algorithm balances exploring new areas of the solution space and refining existing solutions.
4.	Simple and Fast: PSO is easy to implement and computationally efficient.
Key Steps in PSO
1.	Initialization
o	Particles are randomly initialized in the search space.
o	Each particle has a position x (representing a potential solution) and a velocity v (representing the direction and speed of movement).
o	Each particle also keeps track of:
	Its own best position (pbest)
	The global best position (gbest found by the entire swarm).

2.	Fitness Evaluation
o	Each particle’s position x is evaluated using the objective function.
o	The fitness value determines how good the particle’s current position is relative to the optimization goal (e.g., minimization or maximization).

3.	Update Personal and Global Bests
o	Personal Best: If the particle’s current position is better than its personal best, update pbest.
o	Global Best: If any particle’s current position is better than the global best, update gbest.

4.	Velocity Update
o	The particle’s velocity v is updated based on three components:
	Inertia (ω\omegaω): Keeps the particle moving in its current direction.
	Cognitive Component: Attracts the particle toward its personal best position.
	Social Component: Attracts the particle toward the global best position.
5.	Position Update
o	The particle’s position is updated using its new velocity.
o	This moves the particle to a new location in the search space.

6.	Termination
o	The algorithm stops when a termination condition is met, such as:
	A maximum number of iterations.
	The swarm’s fitness no longer improves significantly.
	A satisfactory solution has been found.
