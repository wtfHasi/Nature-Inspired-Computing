A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a population-based optimization technique inspired by Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution, focusing on survival of the fittest.
________________________________________
1. Initialization
A population of candidate solutions (called chromosomes) is randomly generated.
Each chromosome represents a potential solution and is encoded as a sequence of genes (typically binary strings, integers, or real numbers).
2. Fitness Evaluation
Each chromosome is evaluated using a predefined objective function, which quantifies how "fit" or "good" the solution is for the given problem.
3. Selection
Chromosomes with higher fitness are more likely to be selected for reproduction. This simulates the "survival of the fittest."
Common selection techniques include:
o	Roulette Wheel Selection: Probability of selection proportional to fitness.
o	Tournament Selection: Randomly selecting a subset of chromosomes and choosing the best one.
4. Crossover
Two parent chromosomes are combined to produce offspring by exchanging parts of their genetic information. This introduces diversity into the population.
o	Single-point crossover: Swap genes after a random point.
o	Multi-point crossover: Swap genes at multiple points.
o	Uniform crossover: Randomly decide which parent's gene to inherit for each position.
5. Mutation
Small random changes are introduced in the offspring's genes to maintain genetic diversity and avoid premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.
6. Replacement
The offspring replace the less fit members of the current population to form the next generation. This ensures continuous improvement.
7. Termination
The algorithm stops when a predefined condition is met, such as:
o	A maximum number of generations.
o	A solution with acceptable fitness is found.
o	No significant improvement in fitness over several iterations.
